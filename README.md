To make this playground, I used the Xcode Swift Playgrounds template from Apple (https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=playground)

While it was suggested to use BookCore and the `LiveView.swift` files on each page, I decided to skip that and put what little boilerplate I had in a hidden codeblock inside `main.swift`.
